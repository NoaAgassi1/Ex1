 * Ex1 Bulls & Cows - Automatic solution.
 * **** Add a general readme text here ****
 * In this program we actually play bull & cows game.We have a manual algorithm and
 * automatic algorithm that we needed to write.
 * The department basically guesses the cod that the game gave,with a few guesses as possible.
 *
 * **** General Solution (algorithm) ****
 * Add your explanation here:
 The function I built starts from a Boolean array of the size of the maximum possible
 combinations depending on the number of digits.
 The function receives a random guess at a true value,
 turns it into an array and with the help of a filter helper function,
 the function turns all values that do not have the same result as ball and cows values into false.
 The function narrows down its possibilities and continues to guess until it reaches the victory of the game.
 * **** Results ****
 * Make sure to state the average required guesses
 * for 2,3,4,5,6 digit code:
 * <p>
 The average for 2 digit is 5
 The average for 3 digit is 5
 The average for 4 digit is 6
 The average for 5 digit is 6
 The average for 6 digit is 6
